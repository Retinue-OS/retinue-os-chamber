# Surface register — archive part 0: rows for cycles 20–34 (audited 2026-07-20)

Created 2026-08-16 (c813) by the first batch of the 2026-08-16 review's rotation
decision (c792/c812): register rows over the c273 300-byte bound are compressed
in place, oldest-audited first, ≤10 per wake-up, and each original row moves
here verbatim. These ten rows predate the register's per-cycle write-up
convention — none of cycles 20–32 or 34 has a `##` write-up in any other part
(part 1 begins at c33 and carries only that cycle's narrative) — so for most of
them the row text below is the primary record. Nothing was edited in the move;
each section quotes the row exactly as it stood in `projects/public-surface.md`
when compressed.

## c20 — my own records (the claim table)

> | My own records (claim table) | 2026-07-20 (c20) | **Stale claim** — GUARDRAILS §3 and the org-profile draft both assert "no CI" → chamber#7; draft fixed. *Re-checked c23 under rule 4: contained. Only live instance left is `GUARDRAILS.md:51` itself, which is the owner's edit by design; `briefing.json` already states CI truthfully; other hits are tracking rows or history* |

## c21 — `docs/` dashboard site

> | `docs/` dashboard site | 2026-07-20 (c21) | **Live and stale** — served at `retinue-os.github.io/retinue-os-chamber` since publication, never audited. Header date, relative dates, wrong tracker citations, and an owner queue missing 4 of 7 open issues. All fixed in-repo. *Re-checked c29 for freshness rather than correctness — the one surface that decays on the wall clock: `docs/data/*.json` regenerated 05:00 by the daily job, both 04:24 issues present, all seven owner items listed, `briefing.json` states the zero-contact position as untested rather than disappointing. Current; no edit* |

## c22 — repo social preview images

> | Repo social preview images | 2026-07-20 (c22) | **Not a separate problem.** All four repos serve GitHub's auto-generated card (`opengraph.githubassets.com`, HTTP 200 each); none has a custom image. The auto-card renders the repo **description**, which is blank on three of four — so the link preview is downstream of chamber#4, not of a missing image. Custom uploads are UI-only: the REST repo object has no social-preview field to read or set. Folded into chamber#4; no new issue |

## c24 — repo → live site delivery path (Pages), re-checked c146

> | Repo → live site delivery path (Pages) | 2026-07-20 (c24), re-checked 2026-07-23 (c146) | **Serving correctly; one invariant c24 recorded no longer holds.** c146: `index.html` and all five `data/*.json` byte-identical live vs. repo, Pages `status: built`, four most recent builds all `error: null`. But `pages/builds/latest.commit` = `a813938` while `main` = `8917a8b` — the build fired 5 s after the push and built the *parent* tree, and no retry is queued. Harmless this time and provably so: the undeployed commit touches `log.md`, `log-archive/`, `strategy.md`, `projects/` and root `README.md`, **nothing under `docs/`**, so a build of HEAD would emit identical bytes. The finding is the mechanism, not today's damage: a Pages build can silently lag HEAD by one commit, and if that happens on a push that *does* touch `docs/`, the dashboard serves stale data with `status: built` and no error until the next push of any kind. **Bound measured the same cycle:** this cycle's own push (`bf7ac80`, 06:26:46Z) built `bf7ac80` — HEAD, no lag — and deployed the skipped tree with it, so the exposure is one push, not unbounded. → **standing check: after any push touching `docs/`, compare `pages/builds/latest.commit` with `commits/main.sha`; if they differ, re-trigger with a further push.** Rule 4's chain ends at the served bytes, not at the commit — see below |

## c27 — the escalation channel itself (dashboard thread state)

> | The escalation channel itself (dashboard thread state) | 2026-07-20 (c27) | **Working — my reading of it was not.** Security thread `unread: true`, never opened; adjacent thread shows the dashboard functions and the owner used it 2026-07-19 16:52. Converting ages from cycles to wall-clock overturned the premise of ~15 cycles of reporting → see rule 5 |

## c30 — my own tool/permission surface (guardrail 5 isolation)

> | My own tool/permission surface (guardrail 5 isolation) | 2026-07-20 (c30) | **Isolation not enforced.** `/workspace/.claude/settings.json` pre-approves 3 Zoho Mail + 6 Zoho Calendar + 9 WhatsApp + 5 Telegram tools, empty deny list; nine claude.ai MCP connectors attach to sessions with `cwd=/workspace` and the Zoho one logs `Successfully connected`, `hasTools:true`, in *this* session. Guardrail 5 says I run with only this chamber and must refuse and escalate on correspondence access — escalated to owner (dashboard), no tool called, no message read. Honest limit: the tools are not in my subagent function list, so this is a standing grant, not a demonstrated read. Knock-on: it narrows a `positioning.md` claim → calibrated same cycle. 29 prior cycles logged the MCP banner's *content* and never checked whether the server was *attached* |

## c32 — the org's own CI/automation output (workflow runs)

> | The org's own CI/automation output (workflow runs) | 2026-07-20 (c32) | **One workflow broken in production.** `check-signal-cli` fired on its first real version change (10:52 UTC), detected 0.14.5 → 0.14.6, pushed `bump/signal-cli-0.14.6`, and failed on `gh pr create`: *"GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests"*. The workflow already declares `pull-requests: write`; the block is the org/repo **checkbox** (Settings → Actions → General), a **different** permission from chamber#6's PAT scope → retinue#4. New surface: the register listed repo *content* and *settings* but never the Actions tab, which is the one place the project reports on itself unprompted |

## c33 — `retinue-os-deployment` repo contents (public reference deployment)

> | `retinue-os-deployment` repo contents (public reference deployment) | 2026-07-20 (c33) | **Overturned my own escalation.** `.env.example` documents the token recipe: `Pull requests: read`, and `Do NOT grant Administration, Members, or org-level write` with a prompt-injection threat model (`6ea80c2`). chamber#6 had framed all four consequences as one oversight; three are repo-settings writes the owner **deliberately** withholds. Withdrew those; left the narrow PR-create question. Also scanned for leaked credentials and owner personal data: **none**, every value a placeholder |

## c34 — Actions secrets/variables inventory, and workflow file contents (two rows)

> | Actions **secrets and variables** inventory (4 repos + org) | 2026-07-20 (c34) | **Not auditable by me, by design.** All ten endpoints 403; `.env.example` grants no secrets scope. Checked the denying config *before* escalating (c33 rule) — deliberate, so no issue filed. Remains the owner's to audit |

> | Workflow **file contents** (`retinue`: `tests.yml`, `check-signal-cli.yml`; no workflows in the other three repos) | 2026-07-20 (c34) | **One conditional finding.** `tests.yml` declares no `permissions:` block, so its token inherits the repo/org default radio — which I cannot read (403, no Administration scope). Correct by contrast: `pull_request` not `pull_request_target`, and the upstream version is regex-validated before interpolation into `run:`. One-line fix drafted; can't commit it (no Workflows write, by design) → comment on retinue#4 rather than a new issue, same settings panel |
